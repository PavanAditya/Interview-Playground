# Interview Playground

### Description:
This repository is a collection of practice problems I'm working on to improve my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Dynamic Programming (DP), and JavaScript fundamentals. It serves as a playground to explore solutions for potential interview questions.

### Structure:

**DSA & Algorithms:** This folder contains problems related to data structures, algorithms, and dynamic programming techniques.
**JavaScript Fundamentals:** This folder explores core concepts and interview questions specific to vanilla JavaScript.

### Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to contribute your own interview questions or alternative solutions! This repository is meant for collaborative learning and improvement.
