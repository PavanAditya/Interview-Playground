# Climbing Stairs (Amazon Delivery Route Optimization)

An Amazon delivery driver needs to deliver a package to a specific floor in a building. The building has n floors. The driver can take either one or two steps at a time when using the stairs. Due to time constraints, the driver needs to know the number of distinct ways they can reach the top floor. Given the number of floors n, determine the number of distinct ways the driver can reach the top.

**Sample Input 1:** n = 2 (2 floors)
**Sample Output 1:** 2
**Explanation 1:** Ways: 1+1, 2
**Sample Input 2:** n = 3 (3 floors)
**Sample Output 2:** 3
**Explanation 2:** Ways: 1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1
**Sample Input 3:** n = 1 (1 floor)
**Sample Output 3:** 1
**Explanation 3:** Way: 1
**Sample Input 4:** n = 5 (5 floors)
**Sample Output 4:** 8
**Explanation 4:** Ways: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+2+2, 2+1+2, 2+2+1
